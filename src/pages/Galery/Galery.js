      Our famous Spanish artist Pablo Picasso did not have a single gallery dedicated to his works during his lifetime. Instead, his art was shown and sold through various galleries and dealers around the world. However, after Picasso's death in 1973, his family established the "Mus√©e Picasso" in Paris, France, which houses a large collection of his artworks. The museum was opened in 1985, and it includes over 5,000 works of art, including paintings, sculptures, drawings, and prints.
